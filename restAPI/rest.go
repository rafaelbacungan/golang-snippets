	The data for creating a new event comes from the user's end when the user inputs data in the form of an http request
	data. When input, the request data is not in a form that is readable by humans, so to translate it into a slice, we
	use the package ioutil.

	After it has been translated into a slice we fit into an event struct by unmarshalling it. Once the slice is
	successfully created, we can append the event struct into the new events slice and show the new event with an http
	response of 201 Created Status Code.
